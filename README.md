# Product Rating Prediction using Wide and Deep Learning Model

This is my group project assignment 3 of COMP4332 Big Data Mining and Management in HKUST.

This project invloves using the wide and deep learning model (which is commonly used in recommendation system) to predict the product ratings by the users.

You should see the following things in this repository:

* code.ipynb: the Jupyter Notebook
* COMP4332 Project 3 Report.pdf: the report for this project
* evaluate.py: the python file to evaluate the root mean squared error on the prediction
* model.h5: the model weight of the wide and deep model
* prediction.csv: the submitted rating prediction on the testing dataset
* Project3_Rating_Prediction_Spring2024.pdf: the description of this project
* data: the folder that contains the training dataset, the validation dataset, the testing dataset and the product information
* submission: the submission for this project

## How to run?

1. Upload the jupyter notebook and the data folder to the same directory on Google Drive
2. Open Google Colab and change the location path of the data files if necessary
3. Run all the code at once
